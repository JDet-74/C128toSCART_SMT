<h3>A further in SMT developed Version of the C128toSCART_THT project.</h3>
<p>In a few weeks a further development of the "C128toSCART" project can be found here.</br>
It is a second version of the SMT variant with only a few THT components left.</p>
<hr />
<p>The project can be ordered with the <strong>GERBER, BOM and PNP</strong> files directly from JLCPCB.
JLCPCB offers an <strong>"SMT Assembly Service"</strong> where up to 50 PCBs can be ordered.</p>
<hr />
<p>I will soon put pictures of the current prototype online.</p>
